        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>
          During my internships, I worked on the Amazon Store team, supporting businesses looking to join the platform. 
          I developed and implemented solutions to enhance my team's ability to identify bugs and test code efficiently, primarily using Java. 
          This role provided me with extensive hands-on experience with JUnit for unit testing and various AWS services, 
          closely aligning with responsibilities typically associated with quality assurance engineering.
        </p>
