    <!-- Abstract -->
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>This research investigates the intricate relationship between job compensation 
        and the cost of living, offering novel insights into the contemporary employment 
        landscape. Focusing on millennials and recent graduates navigating the job market, 
        the study employs a unique approach by evaluating compensation within the context 
        of specific regions. Distinguishing itself from existing literature, the research 
        utilizes a random forest regression to integrate geographical factors, shedding 
        light on how location contributes to the compensation dynamics. The research 
        leverages meticulously curated datasets, aligning with the 2023 US job market. 
        Despite challenges in data processing and model training, the logistic regression 
        models provide valuable categorization of job sectors and seniority levels. The 
        study contributes to ongoing employment discussions, prompting further exploration 
        of nuanced factors influencing compensation in the modern workforce.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In contemporary discourse, employment and compensation discussions, particularly 
        among the younger generation, are widespread. The challenges of securing 
        employment and concerns about relatively low salaries are persistent topics. 
        This paper addresses the pertinent question of how individuals in the modern 
        era are remunerated, focusing on substantiated data. Beyond job-seeking concerns, 
        it examines economic disparities' broader implications for employee well-being. 
        As millennials and recent graduates navigate the job market, this project 
        evaluates job compensation in specific regions concerning the cost of living. 
        Going beyond simplistic predictors, it explores the real-world impact on 
        individuals' lives. While existing research has explored salary prediction models, 
        with notable works such as Jackman and Reid's (2013) "Predicting Job Salaries 
        from Text Descriptions," this essay distinguishes itself through its unique focus 
        on the geographical aspect of job locations and an end goal not of prediction, 
        but inference and analysis. Through this exploration, the essay aims to 
        contribute novel insights into the intricate factors shaping modern job salaries.</p>

    <!-- Selecting the Data -->
    <h2>Selecting the Data</h2>
    <p>The foundation of my research lies in two distinct datasets meticulously curated 
        to unravel the intricacies of the United States job market in 2023. 
        The primary source, the Kaggle job posting dataset, encompasses approximately 
        33,000 job postings extracted from the LinkedIn website. The allure of this 
        dataset lies in its focus on the United States, aligning seamlessly with our 
        research interests. The temporal relevance of the data, being from 2023, ensures 
        a current and pertinent examination of the job market. From the multitude of 
        columns available, we selected key features crucial to our analysis, including 
        job descriptions, titles, skills, and salary details (maximum, median, and minimum). 
        To ensure the robustness of our analysis, we excluded job postings outside the 
        United States and removed entries lacking salary information. Given that our primary 
        focus was on average or median salaries, we normalized job postings with salary ranges 
        by averaging them. For jobs with hourly wages, we converted them to annual salaries by 
        multiplying with 2080. Recognizing the limitation of this approach, we acknowledge a 
        potential overestimation of average salaries. Furthermore, we refined the dataset by 
        eliminating entries with a generic location like "United States" without specifying a 
        state or city. This meticulous curation resulted in a dataset comprising around 12,500 
        job postings, setting the stage for our subsequent analyses. The integration of 
        geocoding API facilitated harmonization of job locations across datasets.</p>

    <p>The second dataset, abbreviated as COL (Cost of Living), consists of cost of 
        living indices for approximately 500 US cities in 2021. Each entry includes city, 
        state, and the cost of living index. Given the importance of comparing purchasing 
        power, we multiplied the cost of living index by the average yearly expenditure 
        for 2020 ($61,334) and 2023 ($72,967). This enhancement enables meaningful cross-
        year comparisons, enriching the dataset's utility. Similar to the job dataset, 
        geocoding API was employed to align city locations consistently.</p>

    class="float-right">

    <p>In this research, logistic regression was employed as the primary modeling 
        approach to classify job sectors and seniority levels within the dataset. 
        The rationale behind choosing logistic regression lies in its suitability for 
        categorical prediction, precisely aligned with the nature of the research question 
        aiming to discern potential associations between job factors and higher wages or 
        superior job opportunities within specific geographic regions. Logistic regression 
        is well-established for categorical outcome prediction and thus was deemed apt for 
        the task at hand. The dataset, comprising a total of 10,500 entries once non-geocodable jobs were removed, underwent a 
        rigorous labeling process involving logistic regression for job sectors and 
        seniority levels. To facilitate model training and testing, a 70/30 train-test 
        split was implemented on a final dataset containing 300 entries that I hand labeled. 
        The final eleven job sectors were decided by condensing the job sectors found on 
        Careerpilotâ€™s website. This strategic partitioning enabled the creation of 
        reliable predictive models. This graph highlights the average percentage 
        difference in purchasing power across popular US cities. It reveals significant 
        disparities, with some cities offering salaries well above the cost of living, 
        while others fall short.</p>

    <!-- Results -->
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of the logistic regression models for job sectors and seniority 
        levels provide valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of the 
        trained models. The accuracy scores obtained during the training process serve 
        as crucial metrics for evaluating the models' performance. The logistic regression 
        model for job sectors achieved an accuracy score of 0.33, indicating a lower 
        predictive performance in categorizing job sectors. In contrast, the model 
        predicting job seniority levels exhibited a more favorable accuracy score of 0.74, 
        signifying a higher degree of precision in predicting seniority.</p>

    <p><strong>Box plot of cost of living percentage difference by job posting seniority.</strong> 
        This box plot illustrates the disparity in compensation relative to the cost 
        of living across different seniority levels. Senior positions consistently 
        offer salaries above the cost of living, while junior positions fall significantly 
        below. This raises important questions about equitable compensation for 
        entry-level roles.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This research delves into a comparative analysis of the cost of living 
        across different locations, contributing valuable insights to the field of 
        employment research and opportunities. The study explores a potential avenue 
        for future researchers, suggesting ways to enhance categorization within job data 
        for more nuanced analysis. The outlined method is poised to aid in creating more 
        specific job information categories. The findings challenge the perception of job 
        salaries falling below the cost of living in specific areas. However, it is 
        crucial to note that the dataset had several limitations that may have affected 
        the effectiveness of this iteration of this research project.</p>
